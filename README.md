*   **Backend:** Node.js server handling business logic and API requests.
*   **AI Integration:** Secure proxy server managing prompts and responses to the OpenAI API.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilizes CRM custom objects for metadata and a secure cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3) for final PDF documents.
